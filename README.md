# GAN-Animal-Generation-and-Latent-Space-Interpretation

## Project Overview
### This project explores both Conditional (ACGAN) and Unconditional GAN architectures to generate realistic animal images using the [AFHQv2 512Ã—512 animal faces dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/dimensi0n/afhq-512). The conditional model allows for class-controlled image generation, while the unconditional counterpart serves as a baseline of sorts to evaluate the performance without class guidance. Together, they provide a holistic view of how class conditioning and latent space structure affect output quality and interpretability of the latent space.
